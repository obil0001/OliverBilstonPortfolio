# Objectives 
Design retractable landing gear, inside a constrained volume and mass. This system must support a load of 8 kg each during landing phases and had integrate seamlessly into the drone's fuselage during cruise flight mode for aerodynamic efficiency. The landing gear must meet specific criteria, including weight minimization to complement the aircraft's endurance and efficiency goals.
It is crucial that the gear is compatible with existing MUAS control systems (e.g., interfacing with Mission Planner via Cube Orange) and fits within predetermined volume constraints see (Appendix A). The designed landing gear is required to be built to a flightworthy standard, ensuring reliability and safety through external pre-integration testing. 
Additionally, the project mandates a modular design approach for the landing gear, enabling easy replacement or modification using standard workshop tools without permanent alterations to the aircraft's fuselage. This requirement underscores the emphasis on versatility and maintainability in the project's objectives.

### Technical Details
Much of this project was done using CAD. However, a number of unique designs were initially put forward for this project before we settled upon the final design, And even after that there was lots of iteration on individual parts to optimize them. The Landing gear was manufactured using a combination of light machining techniques, 3d printing and composites layups.
